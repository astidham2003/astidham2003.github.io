                    <p>
                        I'm a software developer with 4 years experience developing, debugging, testing, and documenting
                        a variety of enterprise applications.  I have worked with the full microsoft stack - ASP.NET,
                        C#, and SQL Server - and also have exposure to client side development.

                        <h3>Full Stack MES</h3>
                        <p>
                            A multi-million dollar project spanning several years and consisting of a team of over 20
                            engineers and developers.  This project allowed the customer to manage locations across the
                            midwest and east coast.  My contributions included developing custom reports, HMI's, 
                            database tables/procedures, frontend web application, and utility tools.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A fast paced proof of concept application integrating blue tooth beacons with iPads to bring data
                            personnel on plant floors faster.  As one of only two developers on the project I created
                            the mobile code and implemented the interface for the iPad.

                            A mature web application used by operators to manage millions of dollars in product along
                            the east coast.  My role involves debugging the backend service code, analyzing data from
                            the field, and applying service code fixes.
