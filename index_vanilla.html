                    <p>
                        I'm a software developer with 4 years experience developing, debugging, testing, and documenting
                        a variety of enterprise applications in a collaborative environment.  I have worked with the
                        full Microsoft stack and additionally had exposure to client-side programming.

                        <h3>Full Stack MES 1</h3>
                        <p>
                            A multi-million dollar multi-phase project spanning several years.  This project provided the customer with a custom web application that allowed them to manage more than 60 properties in various locations across the Midwest aned East Coast from a single room.  In addition to the web application, custom reports, HMI displays, and utility programs saved the customer money by reducing down time due to unplanned maintenance, human error, and fines.  I contributed to this project by writing ASP.NET MVC server-side code, modifying client-side code, debugging code written by myself and others, and testing code written by myself and others.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>iOS application</h3>
                        <p>
                            A fast paced proof of concept iOS application integrating blue tooth beacons with iPads.  The customer used this project to demonstrate to their CEO how leveraging technology could save money by reducing equipment downtime.  An iPad would detect blue tooth beacons placed on equipment and allow maintenance personnel to access HMI's, maintenance records, and repair request details related to that equipment.  I contributed to the project by implementing the iPad interface that would later be shown to the customer's CEO and by implementing the code to detect the blue tooth beacons.

                        <h3>Full Stack MES 2</h3>
                        <p>
                            A project to expand a custom MES system designed and built by the customer to additional manufacturing facilities.  The application added value at its current location by automating material allocation in a complex manufacturing process eliminating missed delivery deadlines.  Additionally, the application provided web reports showing what orders were in process at each location in the current plant.  I contributed to the project by developing the ASP.NET Web API backend, writing Python scripts to poll SAP data, and modifying client-side code.

                        <h3>Backend MES</h3>
                        <p>
                            This project is a complex web application to aid operators in managing a continuous flow of millions of dollars in product along the East Coast.  The customers return on investment comes from removing an antiquated pen and paper management process and replacing it with a semi-automated process.  I am contributing to this project by debugging, implementing code fixes, writing SQL queries to identify patterns in the input and output data, leading the manual test effort, and mentoring junior developers.

                        </ul>
                        <p>I've also built reports in Excel using VBA, and written some small scripts in Python.  Lastly, I've used basic functionality of Git and SVN for source control.</p>
                        <p>Moving forward I see myself continuing to grow toward a full stack developer and eventually a senior developer.</p>
